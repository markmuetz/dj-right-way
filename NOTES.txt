Followed instructions here to get things up and running: http://bscientific.org/blog/mezzanine-fabric-git-vagrant-joy/
Involved getting virtualbox setup (straightforward), editing local_settings and adding the fabric details.
Took a few hours to carry out instructions.

These commands should work:

workon dj-right-way
vagrant up
fab all
fab deploy

Then you will have to edit /etc/hosts and add in djrightway as an alias for 192.168.33.10
Then go to http://djrightway/
You should see a fully deployed mezzanine CMS.
